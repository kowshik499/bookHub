# Book Hub Application

In this project I've built a **Book Hub** by applying the concepts of React.js

I've created an app that will fetch data from an internal server using a class component, displaying that data, using **component lifecycle** methods, **routing** concepts, **authentication**, and **authorization**, and adding responsiveness to the website.
